The task of online operational planning and control functions in a control center, such as contingency analysis, is computationally demanding and hundreds of simultaneous power flow (PF) calculations should be performed. As practical and cost-effective tools for speedup calculation, this paper presents the implementation of simultaneous parallel PF calculations using GPU. For the practical and fair comparison, the proposed GPU based parallel PF is compared with CPU based PF. The test results using 14, 30, 57, 118, 300, 1354, 2869, and 9241 bus systems for single, 10, 50, 100, 200 simultaneous parallel PF calculations verify the practical speedup of the proposed method.
